# cypress-end-to-end
Cypress guided project starter

Steps before class:
- [ ] **Fork** this repository, then clone your fork.
- [ ] **In the root of this directory**: Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
- [ ] Run the server using `npm start` 
- [ ] In a separate terminal `npm install cypress --save-dev`

**This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.**


We will install cypress before class starts because this takes some time to do.
